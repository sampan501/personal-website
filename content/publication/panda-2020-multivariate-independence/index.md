abstract: With the increase in the amount of data in many fields, a method to consistently
  and efficiently decipher relationships within high dimensional data sets is important.
  Because many modern datasets are multivariate, univariate tests are not applicable.
  While many multivariate independence tests have R packages available, the interfaces
  are inconsistent and most are not available in Python. We introduce hyppo, which
  includes many state of the art multivariate testing procedures. This thesis provides
  details for the implementations of each of the tests within a test hyppo as well
  as extensive power and run-time benchmarks on a suite of high-dimensional simulations
  previously used in different publications. The documentation and all releases for
  hyppo are available at https://hyppo.neurodata.io.
