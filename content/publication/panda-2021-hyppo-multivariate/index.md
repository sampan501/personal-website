abstract: We introduce hyppo, a unified library for performing multivariate hypothesis
  testing, including independence, two-sample, and k-sample testing. While many multivariate
  independence tests have R packages available, the interfaces are inconsistent and
  most are not available in Python. hyppo includes many state of the art multivariate
  testing procedures. The package is easy-to-use and is flexible enough to enable
  future extensions. The documentation and all releases are available at https://hyppo.neurodata.io.
