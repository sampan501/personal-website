abstract: "Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is an endogenous molecule that plays several important\
  \ roles in brain function: it is generated in cellular respiration, serves as a\
  \ modulator of dopaminergic signaling, and its presence can indicate the upstream\
  \ production of more aggressive reactive oxygen species (ROS). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has been implicated\
  \ in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), creating\
  \ a critical need to identify mechanisms by which H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> modulates cellular processes\
  \ in general and how it affects the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway, in particular.\
  \ Furthermore, there is broad interest in selective electrochemical quantification\
  \ of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, because it is often enzymatically generated at biosensors as a reporter\
  \ for the presence of nonelectroactive target molecules. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> fluctuations can be\
  \ monitored in real time using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) coupled with\
  \ carbon-fiber microelectrodes. However, selective identification is a critical\
  \ issue when working in the presence of other molecules that generate similar voltammograms,\
  \ such as adenosine and histamine. We have addressed this problem by fabricating\
  \ a robust, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-selective electrode. 1,3-Phenylenediamine (mPD) was electrodeposited\
  \ on a carbon-fiber microelectrode to create a size-exclusion membrane, rendering\
  \ the electrode sensitive to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> fluctuations and pH shifts but not to other commonly\
  \ studied neurochemicals. The electrodes are described and characterized herein.\
  \ The data demonstrate that this technology can be used to ensure the selective\
  \ detection of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, enabling confident characterization of the role this molecule\
  \ plays in normal physiological function as well as in the progression of PD and\
  \ other neuropathies involving oxidative stress."
